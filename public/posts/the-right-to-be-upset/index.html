          <p>Let me first just say that <a href="https://nav.al/happiness">this post from Naval</a> is great and is much better than whatever my ramblings on this will be.</p>
<p>1 interview, ~7 rejections, ~25 applications + networking messages, no interview prep. Interview didn&rsquo;t go well. But I think it might just have been a key turning point in my life. At first I got really upset, but then I started to look on the brighter side. I needed this failure to know that I&rsquo;m not really working hard enough right now. I also got some really great feedback about how to improve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been unhappy for a while now, and I think I almost wanted to be. It felt like an advantage of sorts. That being happy would get in the way of what I wanted to achieve, and that being on a consistent hedonic treadmill was actually a good thing because it meant that I was always moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so smart why aren&rsquo;t you happy.&rdquo; Man, I remember telling this to other people and them getting mad at me. The quote comes from Naval, and it&rsquo;s a great way to go about looking at life. Being happy is hard thing at first if you feel like you&rsquo;re not where you want to be in life. But with some effort it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I came to the realization that me being upset was just me being lazy. I had forgotten that <a href="https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/01/14/I'm-the-Luckiest-Man-in-the-World.html">I&rsquo;m the luckiest man in the world</a>.</p>
<p>There are people out there who do have the right to be upset. I am not one of them.</p>
<p>ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ</p>
<p>Here are some goals for next week:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 leetcode questions</li>
<li>150 networking messages</li>
</ul>
