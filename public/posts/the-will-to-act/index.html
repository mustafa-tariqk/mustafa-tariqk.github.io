          <p>Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul is having a sword battle with Bruce Wayne on a frozen lake. Ra&rsquo;s
turns his back towards Bruce, &ldquo;Your parents death was not your fault.&rdquo; Bruce
charges at him and they have an exchange, Ra&rsquo;s catches Bruce and gets closer to
him, &ldquo;It was your fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruce charges again with a flurry of attacks and gets thrown onto the ice.
&ldquo;Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.&rdquo; Bruce finally
replies to his taunts, &ldquo;The man had a gun!&rdquo; Ra&rsquo;s asks if that would have
stopped Bruce. He gets up off the ice and begins another attack.</p>
<p>He again angrily replies back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had training!&rdquo; This time Ra&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t as
gentle, and begins his own attack. &ldquo;Your training is nothing. Will is
everything.&rdquo; Bruce is now again on the ice. &ldquo;The will to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what the hell does that Batman Begins scene have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Throughout all of my time at undergrad, I used it as a reminder to myself.
I&rsquo;m inexperienced, I&rsquo;m unskilled, I&rsquo;m lacking in many things. But my training
is nothing. My will is everything. The will to act.</p>
<p>This mentality is what took me from a first year who didn&rsquo;t know anything to an
exec in multiple clubs. Somewhere along the way, probably after I got an
internship, I lost the will. I thought I had enough things going for me, and
that I could take things more easily, now that I was skilled.</p>
<p>But it came back to bite me, my skills were nothing, and my will to take on
risks, to go out and build. That&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>Now I know it isn&rsquo;t as cool for me to be on my laptop, applying to jobs,
networking, doing leetcode and being all like &ldquo;hell yeah I got the will.&rdquo;
Honestly if I look at it from afar I kind of feel like a loser.</p>
<p>But this mentality here as brought me to apply to more jobs that I think I&rsquo;m
unqualified for and thus get a couple interviews started. Granted all of them
have failed, but I have learned from each of them. And that&rsquo;s what gets me the
skills.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a loop, do things that make you uncomfortable, get better, repeat. The
moment you think you&rsquo;re good enough you stop progressing and things actively
fade. There is no maintaince routine here. Keep pushing. Keep having the will
to act.</p>
<p>As a final aside I think I realized who I&rsquo;m writing this blog for. It isn&rsquo;t
you, random person who stumbled across this thing in the future. It&rsquo;s reminders
to myself right now. To make sure I don&rsquo;t forget things I once told myself in
the past.</p>
