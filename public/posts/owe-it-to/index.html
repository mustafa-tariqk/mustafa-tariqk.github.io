          <p>Reading the old blogs. I give a lot of unsolicited advice. I&rsquo;m just gonna talk about what&rsquo;s working/not working with me from now on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been really useful for motivational stuff is thinking about all the people I owe it to to work hard. Family, friends, everyone who prays for you or wants success for you. You&rsquo;re throwing their good wishes away by not doing your best.</p>
<p>What hasn&rsquo;t been working is the creation and following of some perfect plan. I keep pushing &ldquo;ok, today is pretty much ruined because I couldn&rsquo;t follow the plan, let&rsquo;s start again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like I set a goal last week, and only reached ~30% of it. I knew I could&rsquo;ve done more. 40 messages, 30 practice questions.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the good part, I had an interview that went well, and the next round is on Thursday. This pressure will definitely work in making me work harder.</p>
<p>So tl;dr
works: thinking about family+friends
doesn&rsquo;t work: being a perfectionist</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m killing all notions of a calendar now. There will just be a todo list with small items. Calendar planning takes too much time. ToDo can just be hit one after another, can go around if stuck. No limitations. Let&rsquo;s see how this goes.</p>
