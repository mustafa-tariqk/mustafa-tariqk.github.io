I missed last week. Mostly because I thought I&rsquo;d have some good news to share very soon. Had round 3 at an exciting startup scheduled for Thursday last week. Thursday comes and I get an email asking me to move to next week because interviewer was busy. Alright, no big deal, book Tuesday.
Tuesday arrives, no one shows up to the interview. I prepared a lot on the topics so I made an unlisted youtube vid and sent it to interviewer just in case. They say they missed it because they thought it was Thursday. Ask me about scheduling Sunday." />

          <h2 id="why-i-been-missing">Why I been missing</h2>
<p>I missed last week. Mostly because I thought I&rsquo;d have some good news to share very soon. Had round 3 at an exciting startup scheduled for Thursday last week. Thursday comes and I get an email asking me to move to next week because interviewer was busy. Alright, no big deal, book Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tuesday arrives, no one shows up to the interview. I prepared a lot on the topics so I made an unlisted youtube vid and sent it to interviewer just in case. They say they missed it because they thought it was Thursday. Ask me about scheduling Sunday.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday.</p>
<p>I was originally gonna call this post eggs and baskets, and talk about why this was a mistake. This didn&rsquo;t work for me this time, I got too excited and I let go of everything except focusing on this one company. Well, companies don&rsquo;t exactly do that with candidates, just as they interview multiple. I should be interviewing at multiple places.</p>
<h2 id="whats-going-on-here">What&rsquo;s going on here</h2>
<p>But I think I want to take a good long deep look into myself, and figure out what is going on here. Why don&rsquo;t I have a job yet. Current hypothesis: skill issue. I&rsquo;m going to read all my blogs. Do some reflecting. And come back with a plan.</p>
<p>I see the issue. I knew it after reading the first post. I&rsquo;m a hypocrite. I do not hold myself accountable the way I should. I don&rsquo;t think there are any mind tricks or ways to gas myself up here. I know what I have to do, I just lack the will to do it.</p>
<p>Again, this is kinda out of nowhere though. Like in work I&rsquo;m on top of everything, in school I&rsquo;m on top of everything. I get shit done. But why this stuff specifically?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna walk for a bit and come back after I figure this out. DEADLINES DEADLINES DEADLINES. There are no deadlines. School gave me deadlines, bosses gave me deadlines. I just have an objective with the deadline &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not specific enough. There is also no fear of failure if I do not meet a deadline. Like I just live with my parents. I&rsquo;m not gonna be homeless. I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before in my <a href="https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/01/21/Proof-of-Work.html">Proof of Work</a> post. &ldquo;You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong? It makes you weak.&rdquo; What do I gotta fear? Like nothing.</p>
<p>Time to up the ante, daily twitter posts about what I am doing. I&rsquo;m going to also stick to the structure I mentioned in <a href="https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/02/25/Word-Vomit.html">Word Vomit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-am-i-doinggoing-to-do">What am I doing/going to do</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s worked for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being happy, not cutting people off. Keeping on top of my health and relationships and not letting them go has been great.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s not worked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping to myself, it&rsquo;s time I share what I do much more than I am now. It&rsquo;s easy to lie about myself about progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;m going to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily twitter posts for accountability + some social pressure, also gonna be updating my family with updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big UFC guy. There&rsquo;s a fighter called Max Holloway who fought the same dude 3 times for the championship and lost all 3. Another type of person may have faded into oblivion after all that. He took a different route.</p>
<p>He decided to become undeniable.</p>
<p>He remain undefeated outside to the champ, and put on masterclasses against everyone else in the weight class. Most recently he went up to take a fight that no one thought he was going to win. I literally told my friends that what he&rsquo;s doing is completely stupid. Why take a risk like that, he&rsquo;s gonna lose horribly and be set back.</p>
<p>He remained fearless, and shocked the world by beating the other dude all 5 rounds (imo) and getting an insane knockout the last literal second of the entire fight, after taking a risk I again called stupid, by pointing to the middle of the cage and engaging the other guy in a swinging match.</p>
<p>He put it all out there, and had so much to lose. I need to do the same. Shoutout to Max &ldquo;Blessed&rdquo; Holloway. Hope he takes the belt against the current champ now.</p>
