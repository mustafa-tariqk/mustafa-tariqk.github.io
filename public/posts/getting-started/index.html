          <p>This week was pretty uneventful. I often find myself saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it
tomorrow.&rdquo; My Mom always said &ldquo;Tomorrow never comes&rdquo; when I was a kid but I
never got but as I get older I get it more and more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a complete slob though, I&rsquo;m currently in my final* semester of school
and I&rsquo;m done damn near all of my assignments. Only have 1 left that is
completely untouched (only because it isn&rsquo;t out yet). Other than that I am a
killer when it comes to school assignments, I often get things done the day
they are assigned. Only things I&rsquo;m waiting on are group members to get their
stuff done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this club I&rsquo;m in, Queen&rsquo;s TCF (The Citizens Foundation). We help
raise funds for the larger TCF organization to go build schools and stuff in
Pakistan. That&rsquo;s really low effort though, I&rsquo;m filling out random forms to get
a bunch of permissions. It&rsquo;s not really interesting and I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting
my time. People are cool though. Since I left university to go back home
I don&rsquo;t really get to interact with anyone there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m gonna quit in like 2/3 weeks, just before exams hit and I know
things are gonna be slow in terms of club events.</p>
<p>Anyways onto things that actually matter. The job hunt. I feel like maybe my
entire life has been coming to this moment. Of course I have bigger aspirations
past this but right now this is the most important thing on my list I need to
get done.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason, perhaps the fear of failing. I just have not been
doing anything about it. I&rsquo;m not reaching out to people and I&rsquo;m not doing any
leetcode. It&rsquo;s weird because I do want this more than anything but I keep
delaying it. That stops now though.</p>
<p>Next week you&rsquo;ll see a crazy amount of progress from my side and how I turned
this all around.</p>
<p>*Not really a final semester since I have one more semester to finish my group
capstone project, but I don&rsquo;t have any &ldquo;real&rdquo; classes after this semester</p>
