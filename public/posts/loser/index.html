<p>Posting updates online publicly has definitely been helpful. Feeling some pressure now to get stuff done. But I also kind of feel like a loser. Almost like I&rsquo;m begging for a job.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just a matter of repeating this over to myself. &ldquo;I might be a loser right now, but that&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m planning on staying in this state forever.</p>
<p>This whole thing is an experiment in persistence. So long as I don&rsquo;t give up I haven&rsquo;t really lost. Though it&rsquo;s hard to feel that way at times.</p>
<p>I need to become OK at being a loser, I mean how else am I gonna figure anything out in the future. Gotta suck before getting good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely working, but it&rsquo;s also kind of embarrassing. I&rsquo;m not used to this yet. I also have not gotten shit done today. Been busy since I woke up this morning hanging out with friends. I need consistency and a schedule in my life otherwise I&rsquo;m going to repeat the same mistakes again. Time to setup the master plan:</p>
<p>Wake up
Basement Gym ~1 hour
~ 6 hours:
Job apps (custom resume, cover letter)
Cold messaging + hitting up ppl in my network</p>
<p>~2 hours
Bike in nature</p>
<p>Leetcode rest of the day
Cooldown and relax ~2 hours end of day
Snooze</p>
<p>Strats:
Job apps: custom resume + cover letter for each application. I&rsquo;ve been a little snarky when companies ask you to fill in the same shit again saying &ldquo;refer to resume.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s gotta stop I&rsquo;ll just do as I&rsquo;m told and fill it in again.</p>
<p>Cold messaging + hitting up people in my network. I sort of feel like a fake and a fraud when I do this. I like talking to people for who they are, not for what I can get from them. LinkedIn cold outreach sucks the soul out of me. But I think it&rsquo;s the work that no one likes that needs to get done.</p>
<p>Leetcode: 3 piles, questions for today, failed questions, passed questions. If I do a question and solve it without assistance in under 25 minutes with optimal solution, it&rsquo;s in passed. If I can&rsquo;t, I watch a leetcode video and put it in failed. And try again some later date. Questions for today are pulled from the leetcode 150 list. 10 a day minimum.</p>
<p>I might be a loser right now, but that&rsquo;s OK. I won&rsquo;t be forever.</p>
