          <p>Oh man I almost missed this one haha. This week has been pretty intense. Took a
bit of a break from all the job hunt stuff since I had a big presentation and a
big test that needed to get done. Ended up presenting content I wasn&rsquo;t supposed
to talk about at all because the person before me handed the slides off to me
like 7 slides too early and finished the 1 hour test in 10 minutes. So overall
it sums up to an average week.</p>
<p>Going back to Kingston was nice. I love the air in that city. I don&rsquo;t think
there&rsquo;s a better school in Canada if there was a vibe ranking. Buildings are
all super pretty, great people. Missed that place. I&rsquo;ll be going back in around
2 weeks to get 2 exams done. Computer Vision and Ethics. After exams I&rsquo;ll sum
up my experiences at Queen&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk a bit about rejection. I&rsquo;ve been feeling it recently. I like
completely embarassingly failed this technical interview with this AI 3D image
modelling company. I want to have an excuse but man I think I just shat the bed.
Pressure got to me.</p>
<p>So that rejection was rough even though I knew it was coming, but I think I&rsquo;m
better acclimated to it now. I&rsquo;ve been doing this thing where in a Discord
server with friends I send screenshots of every time I get rejected. That&rsquo;s
been helping me and giving my friends some reassurance that getting rejected is
alright. I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of Nos, and I think it&rsquo;s important that that
happens.</p>
<p>Being OK with rejection is a superpower. Taking rejection and turning it into
feedback is like an ever super-er power. Feedback means you have an opportunity
to get better. And getting rejected means you&rsquo;re aiming high enough.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re living a life where you&rsquo;re not getting rejected and everything is
being more or less handed to you I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re not aiming your sights high
enough. Getting rejected means that you&rsquo;re doing things people don&rsquo;t think you
should be doing. And that&rsquo;s the stuff that you should be out there trying to
get.</p>
<p>I mean I guess there&rsquo;s the other side. Don&rsquo;t be so stupid and just apply with a
shitty application to get rejected with. You have to actually try your best.
Only when that happens is rejection meaningful. Otherwise you knew you pissed
away your shot.</p>
<p>Anyways, for myself this means I need to be collecting more rejections and more
feedback. In my job hunt this will help me learn things to better my prospects
and realize what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
