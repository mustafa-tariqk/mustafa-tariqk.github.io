          <p>tl;dr: Do something, then talk about it.</p>
<p>I deleted the only friction log I made a bit ago. I wasn&rsquo;t really proud of it
and I messed up with organizing it in any way. Fixing it up would require as
much effort as making a new one so I may as well do that.</p>
<p>I made a <a href="https://x.com/mustafa_tariqk/status/1780433932904714573">tweet</a> a
bit ago outlining a goal. I&rsquo;ve failed to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Eid has come and gone and I&rsquo;m in the same position. Sucks but I have a good
idea as to why. Before I jump into that: new goal is to land something by
August 18th. I have a big camping trip then.</p>
<p>A big issue was announcing things before I did them. Title you see in the top
left is &ldquo;What did you get done this week&rdquo; not what are you going to do. Let&rsquo;s
stick to that.</p>
<p>When I posted daily updates before work was done I already pushed that pressure
off me. The post is not the issue the actual work is.</p>
<p>Another thing is consistency. I make these grand plans but have no follow
through. It&rsquo;s too easy to lie on the internet. Very easy to also lie to
yourself. &ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo; is such a nice way to push responsibilities. I&rsquo;d give up
on stuff and say &ldquo;ah well today is ruined. Let&rsquo;s just start tomorrow instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started out strong, very strong. I faced failure and gave up. Slowed to a
hault. Yes I did the weekday meetings to interview prep but I kinda just been
messing around with those. With a close friend interview prep just ain&rsquo;t the
same.</p>
<p>I need to remember who I used to be. In school I was a killer, in my internship
I was a killer, on campus taking my fitness seriously I was a killer. Here&rsquo;s a
fun fact about me. I lost 30 pounds in a month during my last semester in
school. I came home and I got lazy, it&rsquo;s all back.</p>
<p>I read books, I read blogs, I&rsquo;m waiting for the right moment to hit and to
finally start. You want to know something insane? I still haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;started.&rdquo;
Well I have of course, but I haven&rsquo;t had my first &ldquo;perfect day&rdquo; where I stuck
to my plan.</p>
<p>There is no perfect day. Distractions and events will pop up and I will have to
adapt instead of giving up altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one coming to save you&rdquo; is starting to sink in. This is real life
now, not school. No one is going to do this for me, and structure is lost now.
I&rsquo;ve made plans in this blog before. &ldquo;Damn messed up this week now I&rsquo;m going
fix things here&rsquo;s the plan moving forward&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, outside of this blog post. You won&rsquo;t be seeing me talk about what I&rsquo;m going
to do. I&rsquo;m just going to do. Come back next week to see me crush this.</p>
