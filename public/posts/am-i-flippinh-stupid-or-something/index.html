          <p>Got all my exams done. I&rsquo;m effectively done school outside for a capstone
project. Which I will try to complete next week. It was freeing for like a day
but now I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;what do I do with my time.&rdquo; After Wednesday (day of my last
exam) I&rsquo;ve been screwing around this whole week and trying to catch up with
friends. It&rsquo;s been nice, but I should probably get back at it.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays. My family doesn&rsquo;t really celebrate anything so
not much holding me back from working. But yeah, onto todays topic. I&rsquo;m pretty
stupid. But that&rsquo;s alright. Now I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m stupid when it comes to
school, but there has got to be something wrong with my for not getting a job
and making the same mistake year after year. I don&rsquo;t know why I delay this job
search stuff.</p>
<p>This&rsquo;ll be the 7th blog so far, and I&rsquo;ve been doing this every Sunday. I mean
I&rsquo;ve gotten interviews (and got ghosted after 4 rounds&hellip;) but there&rsquo;s gotta be
something. I&rsquo;m pretty stupid. But that&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m just starting out, and I
think I know what to do to get better. I think this mentality is something
everyone needs. To admit that it&rsquo;s alright, not blame imposter syndrome and
be done with it. Though I do think there are cases where that sticks around
longer than it should.</p>
<p>See you next week.</p>
