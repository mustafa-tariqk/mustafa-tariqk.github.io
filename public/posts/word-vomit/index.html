          <p>Every Sunday I spend some time writing here. Mostly I kind of make
stuff up. Usually it&rsquo;ll be about something that I&rsquo;ve been thinking
about for the week but I&rsquo;d like to add a little bit more structure
moving forward. The title up above says &ldquo;What did you get done this
week.&rdquo; I barely really talk about that anymore from the beginning.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s fix that. We&rsquo;re going to have a structure moving forward.
First, let&rsquo;s talk about what I get done that week. This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job applications</li>
<li>Networking messages</li>
<li>Leetcode questions</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Offers (lol)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need some proof of work here. My leetcode account is
<a href="https://leetcode.com/mustafa-tariqk/">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll see if I can find
a good way to show my job applications and networking messages. I
think the move is going to just be trust here. I&rsquo;ll just have a table
of applications, and number of messages for each application.</p>
<p>After some brief updates I&rsquo;d like to talk about my thoughts. I&rsquo;ve
been portraying this like super hard working person who hustles 24/7.
But that&rsquo;s kinda a lie? Or at least not as much of the truth as I&rsquo;d
like it to be. I procrastinate, I fail, I don&rsquo;t always have the best
attitude towards things.</p>
<p>Maybe this will help someone out there. Seeing a regular person who
isn&rsquo;t perfect struggle and get what they want just by working hard.
I think more than anything it&rsquo;ll be helpful to me. Writing has been
a good way to figure out how I&rsquo;m feeling.</p>
<p>We often ask ourselves what do we want. But I don&rsquo;t think we often
ask ourselves what we&rsquo;re going to do to get there. I&rsquo;ve been an
ambitious person every since I was in the fourth grade. But ambition
without action is a waste. If you really want something you&rsquo;ll get
it.</p>
<p>So how am I going to get what I want? At least, my most immediate
want. Simple enough, cycle of leetcode, applications and networking.
I&rsquo;ve gotten an internship before, so I know this is possible for me.</p>
<p>Onto the truth now. I think I&rsquo;m depressed. Not a lot gets me going,
and this whole thing has been a lot of anxiety. I&rsquo;m having trouble
sleeping and I&rsquo;m binge eating. I know this is not good, and I&rsquo;m
hoping that by admitting this here first I can work on it.</p>
<p>I want to be how I talk about myself in this blog. Even admitting
the stuff above makes me feel weak. I shouldn&rsquo;t be like this. I&rsquo;m
hoping that by documenting my process here I can get better.</p>
<p>But again, sitting in pity is useless. And feelings I feel don&rsquo;t
really matter. At least it depends on how you want to live your life.
In the end the only thing that matters is results. I&rsquo;m going to
continue to work hard and get what I want.</p>
<p>I have to remember what I&rsquo;ve written here before. And I think I have
to lie to myself. Oddly enough I feel like that&rsquo;s something that has
worked pretty well. I can trick myself into feeling whatever I want.</p>
<p>Man reading this all sounds super edgy what the hell am I talking
about. Whatever screw it I&rsquo;m not deleting the stuff I wrote above.
All I have now is the belief that given time and effort I&rsquo;ll get
what I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look back at this soon and laugh. Sorry for the trash blog this
week. Hell if anyone outside of me is reading this I&rsquo;m like super
surprised.</p>
<p>The real fun stuff is gonna be when I finally have good news to
share. You&rsquo;ll read the best post from myself about how I landed
whatever I got, some stuff I wish I told younger me. It&rsquo;ll be great.</p>
<p>But the super cool stuff will come after. Where I&rsquo;ll be able to write
about stuff that I actually want to do. Like whatever side project or
work assignment (outside of stuff I can&rsquo;t talk about legally)</p>
<p>See you next week. And wish me luck, I&rsquo;m hearing back about a company
for the next round next week. They&rsquo;re exciting but I don&rsquo;t want to
get my hopes up.</p>
