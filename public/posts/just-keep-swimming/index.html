          <p>Man there really isn&rsquo;t much I can say about this week. It&rsquo;s more of
the same stuff. Had two interviews, doing more leetcode, reaching out
to more people on linkedin. Life overall has been boring.</p>
<p>But at least boring is better than being stressed. I&rsquo;m seeing progress
given the fact that I&rsquo;m getting some interviews and moving along the
process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the part of my journey where I just have to keep at it. Dory
had this attitude in Finding Nemo. I think it helped Marty find Nemo
at the end.</p>
<p>This attitude definitely helped was Andy Dufresne in Shawshank. That
guy hit wall after wall in prison. With the library and getting books
after 6 years. I mean even after the minimal amount of progress he did
get his mindset was still positive. One letter every week for 6 years
to get a couple books and like $200. &ldquo;From now on I&rsquo;ll write 2 letters
a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a great situation, but hearing him say that was a great source of
inspiration. I know if I&rsquo;m consistent with this &ldquo;boring&rdquo; stuff I&rsquo;ll be
alright in the end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;m going through this now vs later in my life where
things may not be so sweet.</p>
<p>For a while it was really hard to have a long term thinking approach
to my situation. I wanted things now and as soon as possible. I&rsquo;ve
learned to become more patient by thinking about the long term
rewards.</p>
<p>The idea that I get to tell my parents whenever I get a job and know
that they&rsquo;ll be proud of me is all I need to not give up.</p>
