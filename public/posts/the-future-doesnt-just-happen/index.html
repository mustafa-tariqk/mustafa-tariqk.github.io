          <p>In school if I had a busy week with a lot of tests and assignments I&rsquo;d often
wish that I could skip this week. As if there was some button I could press to
teleport me until all the hard stuff was over.</p>
<p>I find myself thinking this now during the job search. If only there was a skip
this mission button to get ahead. But something happened to me this week as I
started to work a little bit harder.</p>
<p>3 interviews in 2 weeks. That&rsquo;s the result of this weeks work. I began to see
the fruits of my labour. Obvious now, but I had this realization that nothing
ever really happens for you until you work for it.</p>
<p>Growing up in school it doesn&rsquo;t feel like that. There&rsquo;s a structure in place.
Next year I&rsquo;ll be in the 11th grade, 12th grade, first year university, so on.</p>
<p>Outside of that structure now its clear that the skip button doesn&rsquo;t exist.
But you do have something that can act as a time machine. You control how hard
you push yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to build your future.</p>
