          <p>I have an interview scheduled now which is nice. For a while I was beginning
to lose hope. I&rsquo;m beginning to see how people become NEETs. A part of it has
to be the loss of hope. If you don&rsquo;t believe in yourself you&rsquo;re putting a limit
on what you can do.</p>
<p>In the time when I was becoming a bit of a pessimist, I looked towards
inspiration online. This time from a content creator I hadn&rsquo;t watched since I
was in high school. Casey Neistat.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know who he is, I think he&rsquo;s most popular for making a vlog
every day for 800 days straight without any breaks.</p>
<p>He has a video called &ldquo;NO EXCUSES&rdquo; where he describes bits of his life and
others, talking about the hardships they had, and how they all had to go
through a lot to get to where they are now.</p>
<p>The central idea of the video is this: to achieve your dreams, there are
obstructions you must overcome. Each obstruction that is not overcome,
becomes an excuse. Which means that excuses take the place of your dreams.</p>
<p>Your life will become just your and your excuses.</p>
<p>I had been making excuses for myself. Limiting my aspirations. I didn&rsquo;t even
think about applying to places because I thought I&rsquo;d get rejected anyways, so
why even try. I have had this thought about interviews as well. After I failed
one pretty badly, I thought about cancelling the other.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve been putting excuses on my entire life for a long time. I
didn&rsquo;t get into the school I wanted because I cheated and my English teacher
was unfair. I didn&rsquo;t get internships some summers because well I guess I got
unlucky. The truth for all the excuses I make up are I was too lazy to do the
work necessary.</p>
<p>And of course, of course luck is a thing. There will always be random chance
in there to ruin plans of what you want. But I feel like that&rsquo;s a shitty way
to go thinking about life. You can&rsquo;t control luck, and on average over the long
term luck shouldn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>The only thing between where your life is now, and wherever you want it to be,
is work.</p>
