          <p>This week has been leetcode, projects and linkedin messages. And this will be
my life until I land something. As long as I&rsquo;m consistent with this, things
should work out. It&rsquo;s definately been hard to go through this stuff. Don&rsquo;t get
to see the results of this work for a while.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s been slowing me down is that I feel like I&rsquo;ve always been a
perfectionist. But something I realized about this week is you don&rsquo;t need to be
perfect to start, you just need to start and figure things out along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always wait and plan before any execution, and I&rsquo;d be stuck in this cycle
of planning to ensure I had this perfect setup before going out and trying to
get anything done.</p>
<p>The issue is, delaying any work for a plan doesn&rsquo;t show proof of work. There
has to be some type of evidence out there that shows your skills in some type
of way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think of this blog as my proof of work. At least to myself, this
thing forces me to do something. But maybe I&rsquo;m being too shy about this thing,
and should be talking about it on twitter or something. Maybe that&rsquo;ll give me
the kick in the nuts I really need to move faster.</p>
<p>In the Dark Knight Rises, Bruce Wayne is thrown into a prison that&rsquo;s
essentially a giant hole in the ground. There is a way to climb out, but it
requires that you make a jump that&rsquo;s basically impossible. Luckily there&rsquo;s a
rope to catch people who fail the climb.</p>
<p>Bruce tries to make this climb, but fails. After he discusses it with a fellow
inmate. The inmate tells him, &ldquo;You do not fear death. You think this makes you
strong? It makes you weak.&rdquo; Bruce asks why, and the inmate responds &ldquo;How can
you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most
powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation goes further. The prisoner tells Bruce to make the climb, but
this time, &ldquo;Without the rope, then fear will find you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe being more public about this is me climbing without the rope. But I&rsquo;m
also in a (what I consider to be) super embarassing position. I guess I&rsquo;m still
a university student until this capstone is done in April, but I know that&rsquo;s an
excuse.</p>
