          <p>Man what the fuck am I doing with my time. Not so say that things are being
wasted but I feel like it isn&rsquo;t as effective as it should be. One nice thing I
did this week was catch up with some friends I only see like every 6 months or
so. But other than that what the hell. I didn&rsquo;t manage to get the capstone
project complete.</p>
<p>I should stop complaining, I really should. But man it sucks going to all of
these companies and seeing that they are only hiring senior+ engineers. I think
I&rsquo;ll need a different approach. The root of the problem I have right now I feel
is not setting goals with concrete milestones and tasks. I&rsquo;m just kinda walking
through everything.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a new game plan.</p>
<p>Set aside ~12 hours a day to focus on job hunting. Split into 1/3rds with each
third focusing on projects/leetcode/networking. Something I thought that was
fun was if I saw a really cool startup I could burn the project time on a
feature I think would be cool for the company. Maybe that would help show some
of my skills. For leetcode I&rsquo;ll just run 20 minutes of question and if I&rsquo;m
stuck look at the solution and implement, then put the question in a &ldquo;do again
later&rdquo; pile. And for networking it&rsquo;s all cold approaches on LinkedIn and maybe
some emails.</p>
<p>During a conversation with a friend this week he brought up the idea of taking
a break. I guess I never really thought of that as an option before. I&rsquo;m
someone who&rsquo;s always focused on the next thing and never really takes time to
relax. This is probably not a good thing. Even on family vacations longer than
a few days I start getting angsty and want to get back to work.</p>
<p>I think I know why, I&rsquo;ll talk about it here sometime, but this I feel can be
damaging because I make things worse for my family/friends. Maybe taking a
break would be a good idea, but I could only in good conscious do it after I
get a job. Maybe I&rsquo;ll ask for a start date that&rsquo;s a month from whenever I hear
the news that I got accepted. That would be some time to just wander and let my
brain do random stuff for a while.</p>
<p>But yeah, didn&rsquo;t get a lot of shit done this week. Feeling pretty bad about it.
Now that school is over I&rsquo;m very much aimless and have to rely on self
discipline to get things done. See how I do by reading next weeks blog.</p>
