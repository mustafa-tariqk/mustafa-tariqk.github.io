          <p>Let me first start by saying this is really embarrassing. I guess that&rsquo;s the point of these things. To have some social pressure to get things done. Failure has killed motivation. I&rsquo;ve been slow.</p>
<p>I used to be fast. I used to be really fast. What happened to get me here. And how do I get back. I&rsquo;m beginning to see the cycles. I can read them from this blog.</p>
<p>Things start well, mindset good. Then something good happens. Like I&rsquo;ll get an interview. I start to slow down a bit because of success. Maybe interviews don&rsquo;t go well. Rejections. I go from slow to even slower. Until after a while I rebound.</p>
<p>I need to detach my ego from all of this. I need to find happiness in things other than work. My current approach has been unsustainable.</p>
<p>You wanna know what&rsquo;s weird? I didn&rsquo;t know any of this until I started writing this out. Feeling a lot better now. Looks like I&rsquo;m back on a good part of the cycle. But this time, noticing my patterns. I&rsquo;m not going to fall into despair again.</p>
