          <p>Took me long enough :)</p>
<p>As of October 1st 2024 I work on the backend team of this <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/artificial-intelligence/intent">product</a> at HubSpot. Oh, I also moved to San Francisco. I live in a little studio in West SOMA.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-the-job">How I Got the Job</h2>
<p>One interesting note is I knew no one at the company. I didn&rsquo;t send a LinkedIn message to a recruiter or anything. Complete cold apply.</p>
<p>The interview process was more or less like any other. Started in early August, 3 hour OA, 30 minute behevioural, 2 hour leetcode + sys design. I thought I bombed the OA. But then I got the recruiter call which I prepared for like hell. I killed it and got told I&rsquo;d be moving to next steps within like 30 minutes of finishing the interview.</p>
<p>The final round really spooked me since it was right after a 4 day camping trip where I wouldn&rsquo;t have any time to study. I almost debated cancelling it but I know every time me and my friends take this trip it&rsquo;s really transformative for me.</p>
<p>About a week after final round I got the good news.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-prepped">How I Prepped</h2>
<p>For leetcode + system design + behavioural prep just read the <a href="https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org">tech interview handbook</a>. Made by the person behind Blind 75. Outside of the question list it has a bunch of resources that were super helpful. It&rsquo;s just a matter of practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>One thing that I dragged myself through which I don&rsquo;t recommend and will never do again in my life was basically beg for referrals on LinkedIn. I&rsquo;d message engineering managers/sr swes who worked at companies that had postings in the past 24 hours and message at least 10 who worked at the company point blank asking for a referral.</p>
<p>Seriously demoralizing and soul sucking stuff I had some template where I&rsquo;d highlight why I was a good fit and at the end write something along the lines of &ldquo;any chance I could get some feedback on my resume or possibly a referral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sucks, maybe it works but seriously I don&rsquo;t want to get an interview because some random person that I spammed gave in. I want the interview because someone I know sees me as good enough for the job.</p>
<p>I might even delete my LinkedIn profile. But for now I basically made it as empty as possible and I&rsquo;ll check in on it like once a month.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>For so long this blog was about getting a job. I gave up because I was like so depressed that nothing was changing week to week and wanted to have this blog be more about results. I guess this is a big result.</p>
<p>I want to talk about more technical content moving forward. Random projects, maybe some stuff from work. I&rsquo;m excited to write about something in a while reflecting joining a new company and trying to become a productive member of a team.</p>
<p>I also basically know 0 people in this city. Have to do something about that. Maybe I&rsquo;ll also talk about moving somewhere new and how to get situated after I figure that out.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-feel">How Does it Feel?</h2>
<p>When I heard the news I just let out a big sigh. I don&rsquo;t think I can say that I was excited, more so relieved. Seeing my family and friends be excited for me was got me going.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I felt like super excited until I was at the office one day chasing this bug. I finally got it and fixed the issue and I damn near jumped out of my chair. Man it&rsquo;s so good to be paid for something you love, especially after doing nothing really related to it for so long.</p>
<p>I mean yeah leetcode and system design but they aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To sum it up I&rsquo;m just happy to be here right now. Excited about the future of course, but even more happy about the present.</p>
<h2 id="edit">EDIT</h2>
<p>I deleted all of my old posts, they were kind of super depressing and not really high effort. If you really want to read them go to the commit history of <a href="(https://github.com/mustafa-tariqk/mustafa-tariqk.github.io/tree/cd8fe4a3cdfb10c62f4b27f33ff60a4de5d15b80)">this</a> repo</p>
