          <p>I wish I had done more this week. I had a secret santa thing with friends, then
a cabin trip with family. Both were really fun, but I&rsquo;m feeling kinda guilty
for not doing much. I guess the whole world comes to a bit of a standstill
between christmas and new years.</p>
<p>But then I started thinking that this may be important. I&rsquo;ve had more time to
think and talk with friends/family. You really can&rsquo;t be happy without them, and
it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;re a good friend and family member.</p>
<p>There also may be slow weeks outside of this where you don&rsquo;t get much done. But
maybe in the past a slow week now was a fast week back then? I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m
trying to be positive about this whole thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still dealing with the same problems I&rsquo;ve been dealing with since I started
this blog. But after new years, nothing is in my way. No school (I finished a
lot of the capstone ahead of time and just need to code now). I can focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do my best to make sure that 2024 is the best year of my life. Happy
new years, and I hope when I look back on this blog post, I&rsquo;ll be in a much
better place.</p>
