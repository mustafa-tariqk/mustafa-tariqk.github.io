# ðŸ‘¾ Software Engineer | Seeking SWE Roles

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Mustafa, I graduated with a CS degree at Queen's
University where I also TA'd discrete math and intro cs.

During undergrad, I had the opportunity to be a leader in 7
different clubs. I've also interned at a bank (CIBC), most recently I was in charge for
completing a project for Neuma, a wellness centre. I lead a team to build
an AI therapist of sorts for people to talk about their psychadelics experiences
