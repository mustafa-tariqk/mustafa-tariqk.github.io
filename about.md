## ðŸ‘¾ Software Engineer | Seeking New Grad SWE Roles

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Mustafa, on the verge of wrapping up my CS degree at Queen's University where I also TA'd discrete math and intro cs.

Over the past 4 years I've had the opportunity to be a leader in 7 different clubs. I've also interned at a bank (CIBC), and now I'm in charge for completing a project for Neuma, a wellness centre. I'm leading a team to build an AI therapist of sorts for people to talk about their psychadelics experiences.

Now, I'm looking for new grad roles. I talk about that a lot on my blog
