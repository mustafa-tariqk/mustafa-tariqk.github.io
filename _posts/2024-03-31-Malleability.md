Alright so had round 2 at a startup this week, it went well. Another interview at another startup, also went well. Round 3 next week. It's the final round before a paid work trial. I am cautiously optimistic, but it's hard to not get excited.

Spent most my time on interview prep + school project stuff. We present Monday and I'll be happy to finally be done with school.

I'm finding myself changing opinions on a lot of stuff these days. Kinda wild how malleable I am. Not too sure if this is a good or a bad thing. On one side, I think I'm open minded, on the other do I have no conviction?

Like I no longer feel the way I did 5 weeks ago when I called myself depressed. Not even in the slightest, despite my situation not really changing. Maybe this is good character growth and I'm learning to handle things better.

Also: Ramadan is the best setting for self improvement.
