Got all my exams done. I'm effectively done school outside for a capstone project. Which I will try to complete next week. It was freeing for like a day but now I'm like "what do I do with my time." After Wednesday (day of my last exam) I've been screwing around this whole week and trying to catch up with friends. It's been nice, but I should probably get back at it.

Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays. My family doesn't really celebrate anything so not much holding me back from working. But yeah, onto todays topic. I'm pretty stupid. But that's alright. Now I don't think I'm stupid when it comes to school, but there has got to be something wrong with my for not getting a job and making the same mistake year after year. I don't know why I delay this job search stuff.

This'll be the 7th blog so far, and I've been doing this every Sunday. I mean I've gotten interviews (and got ghosted after 4 rounds...) but there's gotta be something. I'm pretty stupid. But that's alright. I'm just starting out, and I think I know what to do to get better. I think this mentality is something everyone needs. To admit that it's alright, not blame imposter syndrome and be done with it. Though I do think there are cases where that sticks around longer than it should.

See you next week.
