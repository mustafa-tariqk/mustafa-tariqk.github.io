1. Say you'll start tomorrow.
2. Focus on things that don't matter, switch to vim, get a new note taking
service, new calendar. Say you're productive.
3. Stay in your room, don't leave. Just be at your computer all day. Say you're
productive.
4. Set vague, unrealistic goals with no deadlines.
5. Keep planning, say you'll get started when the plan looks good.
6. Wait for inspiration. I'll start studying/working at 10:20, 10:30, 11...
7. Give up. And give up often.
8. Do what's easy.
9. Lie, lie to yourself, lie to others.
