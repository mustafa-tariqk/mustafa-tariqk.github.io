Let me first start by saying this is really embarrassing. I guess that's the point of these things. To have some social pressure to get things done. Failure has killed motivation. I've been slow.

I used to be fast. I used to be really fast. What happened to get me here. And how do I get back. I'm beginning to see the cycles. I can read them from this blog.

Things start well, mindset good. Then something good happens. Like I'll get an interview. I start to slow down a bit because of success. Maybe interviews don't go well. Rejections. I go from slow to even slower. Until after a while I rebound.

I need to detach my ego from all of this. I need to find happiness in things other than work. My current approach has been unsustainable.

You wanna know what's weird? I didn't know any of this until I started writing this out. Feeling a lot better now. Looks like I'm back on a good part of the cycle. But this time, noticing my patterns. I'm not going to fall into despair again.
