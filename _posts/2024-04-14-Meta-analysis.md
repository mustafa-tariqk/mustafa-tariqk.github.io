## Why I been missing

I missed last week. Mostly because I thought I'd have some good news to share very soon. Had round 3 at an exciting startup scheduled for Thursday last week. Thursday comes and I get an email asking me to move to next week because interviewer was busy. Alright, no big deal, book Tuesday.

Tuesday arrives, no one shows up to the interview. I prepared a lot on the topics so I made an unlisted youtube vid and sent it to interviewer just in case. They say they missed it because they thought it was Thursday. Ask me about scheduling Sunday.

Today is Sunday.

I was originally gonna call this post eggs and baskets, and talk about why this was a mistake. This didn't work for me this time, I got too excited and I let go of everything except focusing on this one company. Well, companies don't exactly do that with candidates, just as they interview multiple. I should be interviewing at multiple places.

## What's going on here

But I think I want to take a good long deep look into myself, and figure out what is going on here. Why don't I have a job yet. Current hypothesis: skill issue. I'm going to read all my blogs. Do some reflecting. And come back with a plan.

I see the issue. I knew it after reading the first post. I'm a hypocrite. I do not hold myself accountable the way I should. I don't think there are any mind tricks or ways to gas myself up here. I know what I have to do, I just lack the will to do it.

Again, this is kinda out of nowhere though. Like in work I'm on top of everything, in school I'm on top of everything. I get shit done. But why this stuff specifically? 

I'm gonna walk for a bit and come back after I figure this out. DEADLINES DEADLINES DEADLINES. There are no deadlines. School gave me deadlines, bosses gave me deadlines. I just have an objective with the deadline "as soon as possible."

It's not specific enough. There is also no fear of failure if I do not meet a deadline. Like I just live with my parents. I'm not gonna be homeless. I've mentioned this before in my [Proof of Work](https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/01/21/Proof-of-Work.html) post. "You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong? It makes you weak." What do I gotta fear? Like nothing.

Time to up the ante, daily twitter posts about what I am doing. I'm going to also stick to the structure I mentioned in [Word Vomit](https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/02/25/Word-Vomit.html).

## What am I doing/going to do
What's worked for me:
* Being happy, not cutting people off. Keeping on top of my health and relationships and not letting them go has been great.

What's not worked:
* Keeping to myself, it's time I share what I do much more than I am now. It's easy to lie about myself about progress.

What I'm going to do:
* Daily twitter posts for accountability + some social pressure, also gonna be updating my family with updates.

## Some final thoughts
I'm a big UFC guy. There's a fighter called Max Holloway who fought the same dude 3 times for the championship and lost all 3. Another type of person may have faded into oblivion after all that. He took a different route.

He decided to become undeniable.

He remain undefeated outside to the champ, and put on masterclasses against everyone else in the weight class. Most recently he went up to take a fight that no one thought he was going to win. I literally told my friends that what he's doing is completely stupid. Why take a risk like that, he's gonna lose horribly and be set back.

He remained fearless, and shocked the world by beating the other dude all 5 rounds (imo) and getting an insane knockout the last literal second of the entire fight, after taking a risk I again called stupid, by pointing to the middle of the cage and engaging the other guy in a swinging match.

He put it all out there, and had so much to lose. I need to do the same. Shoutout to Max "Blessed" Holloway. Hope he takes the belt against the current champ now.
