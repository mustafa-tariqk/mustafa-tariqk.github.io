Every Sunday I spend some time writing here. Mostly I kind of make
stuff up. Usually it'll be about something that I've been thinking
about for the week but I'd like to add a little bit more structure
moving forward. The title up above says "What did you get done this
week." I barely really talk about that anymore from the beginning.

So, let's fix that. We're going to have a structure moving forward.
First, let's talk about what I get done that week. This will include:
- Job applications
- Networking messages
- Leetcode questions
- Interviews
- Offers (lol)

We'll need some proof of work here. My leetcode account is
[here](https://leetcode.com/mustafa-tariqk/). I'll see if I can find
a good way to show my job applications and networking messages. I
think the move is going to just be trust here. I'll just have a table
of applications, and number of messages for each application.

After some brief updates I'd like to talk about my thoughts. I've
been portraying this like super hard working person who hustles 24/7.
But that's kinda a lie? Or at least not as much of the truth as I'd
like it to be. I procrastinate, I fail, I don't always have the best
attitude towards things.

Maybe this will help someone out there. Seeing a regular person who
isn't perfect struggle and get what they want just by working hard.
I think more than anything it'll be helpful to me. Writing has been
a good way to figure out how I'm feeling.

We often ask ourselves what do we want. But I don't think we often
ask ourselves what we're going to do to get there. I've been an
ambitious person every since I was in the fourth grade. But ambition
without action is a waste. If you really want something you'll get
it.

So how am I going to get what I want? At least, my most immediate
want. Simple enough, cycle of leetcode, applications and networking.
I've gotten an internship before, so I know this is possible for me.

Onto the truth now. I think I'm depressed. Not a lot gets me going,
and this whole thing has been a lot of anxiety. I'm having trouble
sleeping and I'm binge eating. I know this is not good, and I'm
hoping that by admitting this here first I can work on it.

I want to be how I talk about myself in this blog. Even admitting
the stuff above makes me feel weak. I shouldn't be like this. I'm
hoping that by documenting my process here I can get better.

But again, sitting in pity is useless. And feelings I feel don't
really matter. At least it depends on how you want to live your life.
In the end the only thing that matters is results. I'm going to
continue to work hard and get what I want.

I have to remember what I've written here before. And I think I have
to lie to myself. Oddly enough I feel like that's something that has
worked pretty well. I can trick myself into feeling whatever I want.

Man reading this all sounds super edgy what the hell am I talking
about. Whatever screw it I'm not deleting the stuff I wrote above.
All I have now is the belief that given time and effort I'll get
what I want.

I'll look back at this soon and laugh. Sorry for the trash blog this
week. Hell if anyone outside of me is reading this I'm like super
surprised.

The real fun stuff is gonna be when I finally have good news to
share. You'll read the best post from myself about how I landed
whatever I got, some stuff I wish I told younger me. It'll be great.

But the super cool stuff will come after. Where I'll be able to write
about stuff that I actually want to do. Like whatever side project or
work assignment (outside of stuff I can't talk about legally)

See you next week. And wish me luck, I'm hearing back about a company
for the next round next week. They're exciting but I don't want to
get my hopes up.
