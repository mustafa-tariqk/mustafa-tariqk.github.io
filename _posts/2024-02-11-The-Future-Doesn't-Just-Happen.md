In school if I had a busy week with a lot of tests and assignments I'd often
wish that I could skip this week. As if there was some button I could press to
teleport me until all the hard stuff was over.

I find myself thinking this now during the job search. If only there was a skip
this mission button to get ahead. But something happened to me this week as I
started to work a little bit harder.

3 interviews in 2 weeks. That's the result of this weeks work. I began to see
the fruits of my labour. Obvious now, but I had this realization that nothing
ever really happens for you until you work for it.

Growing up in school it doesn't feel like that. There's a structure in place.
Next year I'll be in the 11th grade, 12th grade, first year university, so on.

Outside of that structure now its clear that the skip button doesn't exist.
But you do have something that can act as a time machine. You control how hard
you push yourself.

It's up to you to build your future.
