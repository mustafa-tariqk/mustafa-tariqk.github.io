More or less spent all of this week studying for an Exam this Friday. It went well, it's a good feeling when you do your best and know you couldn't have done better. I have another exam on Wednesday that I'm studying for now. Being that this is my last full time semester I wanted to talk about school a little bit. Specifically my time at university.

I felt ashamed that I didn't get into my top choices when I applied to university. To the point that I was ashamed of telling people where I was going. In my head my excuse was always that the reason that I didn't get somewhere good was that I cheated on an English essay in grade 12 (I did, and I don't regret it, subject for another time) and that tanked my average. But the truth really is that I didn't really try all that hard.

I convinced myself that I was a hard worker by cramming before exams, that was hard. But I know I could've done better by actually having time management skills and stuff. Glad I have that now.

Now that I'm mostly done school I feel like I'm mostly happy with myself. Things ended up working out for the most part. I think I'll always want more but if I look at things objectively I'm very lucky to be in the poistion I'm in now.

One thing to note. I only paid ~7k a year for school (Canada stuff). And my parents funded a considerable amount of that. That's definately going to have an effect on this. I didn't have to work my way through school like many others did.

The thing is, no matter where you go life really is what you make of it. If you go to school and do nothing but do well in class and get your degree that's totally a waste of time. But to ask of school to hold your hand for everything and get you a job is kinda stupid I feel. People have to figure out how to do that on their own.

Being in clubs, meeting people, that's where the magic is. My time at Queen's is awesome when I think of all the cool people that I met here. My school might not be the best in rankings and stuff but I really think we do have the best student community. There is a club for anything I feel like people generally find their place.

This place is really magical, all these ambitious people here. It really makes me work harder. It's night and day the difference between where I'm here vs my parents place. Take advantage of that.

Still not going to graduation though, that has gotta be a waste of time (sorry mom)

Ok random rambling time. I need to figure out how to get better at writing. I can see my blogs are like mostly shit and I think I need to plan this stuff better.
