Been on a family vacation for a bit so haven't been active. Trying to get back into everything now. Have to avoid the "damn today is pretty much screwed bc I woke up late/didn't manage to get to the gym may as well start tomorrow."

Couple things going to be changing around here. I'm going to start writing friction logs on Saturdays, and personal project dev logs on Sundays, as well as keeping up with all the applications/networking/leetcode.

Writing updates on leetcode and stuff is pretty boring, and I think I'll just leave that shorter stuff to twitter. I'll talk about job hunt stuff after I land something and do a discussion of what worked and what didn't.

See ya!
