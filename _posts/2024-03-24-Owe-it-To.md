Reading the old blogs. I give a lot of unsolicited advice. I'm just gonna talk about what's working/not working with me from now on.

What's been really useful for motivational stuff is thinking about all the people I owe it to to work hard. Family, friends, everyone who prays for you or wants success for you. You're throwing their good wishes away by not doing your best.

What hasn't been working is the creation and following of some perfect plan. I keep pushing "ok, today is pretty much ruined because I couldn't follow the plan, let's start again tomorrow."

Like I set a goal last week, and only reached ~30% of it. I knew I could've done more. 40 messages, 30 practice questions.

But here's the good part, I had an interview that went well, and the next round is on Thursday. This pressure will definitely work in making me work harder. 

So tl;dr
works: thinking about family+friends
doesn't work: being a perfectionist

I'm killing all notions of a calendar now. There will just be a todo list with small items. Calendar planning takes too much time. ToDo can just be hit one after another, can go around if stuck. No limitations. Let's see how this goes.
