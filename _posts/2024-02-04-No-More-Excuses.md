I have an interview scheduled now which is nice. For a while I was beginning
to lose hope. I'm beginning to see how people become NEETs. A part of it has
to be the loss of hope. If you don't believe in yourself you're putting a limit
on what you can do.

In the time when I was becoming a bit of a pessimist, I looked towards
inspiration online. This time from a content creator I hadn't watched since I
was in high school. Casey Neistat.

For those who don't know who he is, I think he's most popular for making a vlog
every day for 800 days straight without any breaks.

He has a video called "NO EXCUSES" where he describes bits of his life and
others, talking about the hardships they had, and how they all had to go
through a lot to get to where they are now.

The central idea of the video is this: to achieve your dreams, there are
obstructions you must overcome. Each obstruction that is not overcome,
becomes an excuse. Which means that excuses take the place of your dreams.

Your life will become just your and your excuses.

I had been making excuses for myself. Limiting my aspirations. I didn't even
think about applying to places because I thought I'd get rejected anyways, so
why even try. I have had this thought about interviews as well. After I failed
one pretty badly, I thought about cancelling the other.

I feel like I've been putting excuses on my entire life for a long time. I
didn't get into the school I wanted because I cheated and my English teacher
was unfair. I didn't get internships some summers because well I guess I got
unlucky. The truth for all the excuses I make up are I was too lazy to do the
work necessary.

And of course, of course luck is a thing. There will always be random chance
in there to ruin plans of what you want. But I feel like that's a shitty way
to go thinking about life. You can't control luck, and on average over the long
term luck shouldn't even matter.

The only thing between where your life is now, and wherever you want it to be,
is work.
