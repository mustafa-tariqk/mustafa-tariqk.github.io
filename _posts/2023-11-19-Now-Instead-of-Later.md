To say things have completely changed would definately be a lie. It's weird how one can get started working nonstop on something but the results come later. Here I am leetcoding and networking daily but I won't reap any rewards until I hit a bunch of nos. I guess a pretty neat thing is someone only has to say yes once.

Maybe it's that none of this really matters. That I should be building real things instead. Projects, small businesses, whatever. Anyone who's done a project knows you learn a billion times more vs a project. But I don't know, I need to get good at interviews first.

One thing I've learned is that you have to learn to love whatever it is you're doing. I think David Goggins said something like that, "Discipline is doing something you hate like you love it." I truly do beleive you can kind of "trick" yourself into believing this is true. Personally, I try to practice a lot of gratitude. It's easy for me to be happy about my situation, regardless of my future ambitions, when I know there are others who have it worse. You can also kind of just glamorize it all. Hype up waking up early, as if it's your first day ever alive. Hype up biking to the gym even though it's only 2 degrees outside. Hype up working on long and difficult problems. Wherever I am in life, there may be millions wishing to be in my exact situation.

Someone retweeted a Sam Altman [quote](https://x.com/sama/status/1345140364995227648?s=20) that I saw and I liked it a lot. "2021 instead of 2022. This week instead of next week. Today instead of tomorrow." Like last week I'm good at doing this at certain things instead of others. Like school work. An assignment came out today and I made it my mission to get it done. I think the key to moving as fast as possible is breaking whatever you're doing into small components that you can do in a really short time burst. Like 5 minutes. 5 minutes is nothing, people throw away 5 minutes like it's nothing on their phones scrolling Instagram. I want to make sure I don't lose my 5 minutes. The opposite of what Sam says is true as well. Tomorrow instead of today, next week instead of this week, next year instead of this year. Time is our most valuable asset. We can't waste it.

To say I'm a legend at productivity and getting things done would be a lie though. I am a bit of a hypocrite. I didn't really get started until Wednesday and spent time watching motivational videos and consuming content. Here's the thing about that. It makes you feel like you did work. When you're watching some Goggins video about his progress from loser to where he is now it's crazy, and you kind of feel like you're a part of the ride. But you're not. You're just in your bed watching the video feeling good about yourself.

The thing about getting productive though, and what I think stops more or less anyone is just getting started. The truth is all the time in my life I spent procrastinating I knew exactly what to do. You can too, just ask yourself if what you're doing is really the best way to spend your time. Once you start thinking about that question a north star does emerge.

I'm writing this whole thing for myself to look back on, but also in the hopes that someone far in the future stumbles across this and can maybe take some inspiration from it. Of course that only works if I'm successful. We'll see if I "make it." Until then, this secret part of the internet is just to hold myself accountable to future me
