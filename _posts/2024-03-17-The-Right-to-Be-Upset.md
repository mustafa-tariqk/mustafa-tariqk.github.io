Let me first just say that [this post from Naval](https://nav.al/happiness) is great and is much better than whatever my ramblings on this will be.

1 interview, ~7 rejections, ~25 applications + networking messages, no interview prep. Interview didn't go well. But I think it might just have been a key turning point in my life. At first I got really upset, but then I started to look on the brighter side. I needed this failure to know that I'm not really working hard enough right now. I also got some really great feedback about how to improve.

I've been unhappy for a while now, and I think I almost wanted to be. It felt like an advantage of sorts. That being happy would get in the way of what I wanted to achieve, and that being on a consistent hedonic treadmill was actually a good thing because it meant that I was always moving. 

"If you're so smart why aren't you happy." Man, I remember telling this to other people and them getting mad at me. The quote comes from Naval, and it's a great way to go about looking at life. Being happy is hard thing at first if you feel like you're not where you want to be in life. But with some effort it's possible.

I came to the realization that me being upset was just me being lazy. I had forgotten that [I'm the luckiest man in the world](https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/01/14/I'm-the-Luckiest-Man-in-the-World.html).

There are people out there who do have the right to be upset. I am not one of them. 

ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ

Here are some goals for next week:
* 100 leetcode questions
* 150 networking messages
