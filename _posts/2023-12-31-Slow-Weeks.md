I wish I had done more this week. I had a secret santa thing with friends, then a cabin trip with family. Both were really fun, but I'm feeling kinda guilty for not doing much. I guess the whole world comes to a bit of a standstill between christmas and new years.

But then I started thinking that this may be important. I've had more time to think and talk with friends/family. You really can't be happy without them, and it's important to make sure you're a good friend and family member. 

There also may be slow weeks outside of this where you don't get much done. But maybe in the past a slow week now was a fast week back then? I'm not sure. I'm trying to be positive about this whole thing.

I'm still dealing with the same problems I've been dealing with since I started this blog. But after new years, nothing is in my way. No school (I finished a lot of the capstone ahead of time and just need to code now). I can focus.

I'm gonna do my best to make sure that 2024 is the best year of my life. Happy new years, and I hope when I look back on this blog post, I'll be in a much better place.
