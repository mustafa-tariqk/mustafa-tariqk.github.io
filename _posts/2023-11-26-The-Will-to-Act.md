Ra's al Ghul is having a sword battle with Bruce Wayne on a frozen lake. Ra's
turns his back towards Bruce, "Your parents death was not your fault." Bruce
charges at him and they have an exchange, Ra's catches Bruce and gets closer to
him, "It was your fathers."

Bruce charges again with a flurry of attacks and gets thrown onto the ice.
"Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act." Bruce finally
replies to his taunts, "The man had a gun!" Ra's asks if that would have
stopped Bruce. He gets up off the ice and begins another attack.

He again angrily replies back, "I've had training!" This time Ra's isn't as
gentle, and begins his own attack. "Your training is nothing. Will is
everything." Bruce is now again on the ice. "The will to act."

So what the hell does that Batman Begins scene have to do with anything?

Throughout all of my time at undergrad, I used it as a reminder to myself.
I'm inexperienced, I'm unskilled, I'm lacking in many things. But my training
is nothing. My will is everything. The will to act.

This mentality is what took me from a first year who didn't know anything to an
exec in multiple clubs. Somewhere along the way, probably after I got an
internship, I lost the will. I thought I had enough things going for me, and
that I could take things more easily, now that I was skilled.

But it came back to bite me, my skills were nothing, and my will to take on
risks, to go out and build. That's everything.

Now I know it isn't as cool for me to be on my laptop, applying to jobs,
networking, doing leetcode and being all like "hell yeah I got the will."
Honestly if I look at it from afar I kind of feel like a loser.

But this mentality here as brought me to apply to more jobs that I think I'm
unqualified for and thus get a couple interviews started. Granted all of them
have failed, but I have learned from each of them. And that's what gets me the
skills.

So it's a loop, do things that make you uncomfortable, get better, repeat. The
moment you think you're good enough you stop progressing and things actively
fade. There is no maintaince routine here. Keep pushing. Keep having the will
to act.

As a final aside I think I realized who I'm writing this blog for. It isn't
you, random person who stumbled across this thing in the future. It's reminders
to myself right now. To make sure I don't forget things I once told myself in
the past.
